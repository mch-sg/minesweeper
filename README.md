# sweep.zone
Sweeping the mine. <br>
<br />  

## Introduction

The product showcased is a rekindled idea of the game Minesweeper. The the game is played by pressing 
the tiles inside the board. The goal in this project was to make an interactive Graphical User Interface.

It is not possible to mark a mine and there is no indication of where the mines are located when a tile is pressed. 
This is thereby a game of chance, where you have to guess the correct tiles to either win or lose.

## Function description

The goal of sweep.zone is to avoid the 5 mines present on the board. If you hit a mine, you will have lost.
The player can win the game by hitting a winning field.

The game was initially meant to serve as a minesweeper. However, I decided to turn it into my own version of the game,
so as not just to copy their original idea, but actually further developing on the idea, and potentially bringing
a new perspective to the gane.

There are 25 fields in total, including 5 mines, and 1 winning field. A 'Retry' and 'Help' button have been added if the player does not understand the
rules of the game. The winning screen and losing screen have been designed similarly to the help screen, see image below for references (red. 1: help, 2: win, 3: lose).
